# survey-js

### 📝 Description:

This is the final assignment for the Client-Side Scripting class at University of Central Florida. The main objective was to build a survey form that offers up hints, uses a variety of input types, and performs basic validation before delivering the results of the survey to the page.

### 🧠 Skills used:
- HTML & CSS
- Vanilla JS
- DOM
- RegEx

### 💪🏼 Challenges:

Overall this was the most challenging project I worked on to date. While developing this survey, I practiced my knowledge of DOM, loops and RegEx for the first time in the real life project. I struggled the most with showcasing check icon and invalid icon upon correct or incorrect input and then make the invalid icon disappear once the input was correct.
